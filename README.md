# 🏠 ZHVI Housing Trends Pipeline

This project analyzes Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI) monthly data across U.S. by zip codes, dating back to year 2000 through May 2025. It automates the ingestion, transformation, and storage of large housing datasets into an SQLite database, enabling clean analysis and dashboard creation.

- Data Source: https://www.zillow.com/research/data/
    - Section: Home Values
    - Reports: ZHVI [1 - 5+] Bedroom Time Series ($)
    - Geography Used: Zip Code
    - Export Date: 6/19/2025

## ⚙️ How It Works

### 1. **Extract**
Raw `.csv` files representing home values by bedroom count are read from the `zhvi_raw_files/` folder.

### 2. **Transform**
- Filters for `RegionType = "zip"`
- Unpivots wide monthly columns into long format
- Extracts bedroom count from file names
- Cleans and converts data types for consistency

### 3. **Load**
The cleaned dataset is saved to `data/zhvi_data.db`, ready for fast SQL querying or dashboard consumption.

## 🔎 SQL Preview: Average ZHVI in Nashville (2020–present)

```
SELECT 
    strftime('%Y-%m', Date) AS Month,
    BedroomCount,
    RegionName AS "Zip Code",
    ROUND(AVG(HomeValue), 2) AS AvgHomeValue
FROM zhvi_data
WHERE State = 'TN' 
  AND City = 'Nashville' 
  AND strftime('%Y', Date) >= '2020'
GROUP BY Month, BedroomCount, RegionName
ORDER BY "Zip Code", BedroomCount, Month;
```
